# Background

The pharmaceutical ecosystem is seeing rapid growth of open-source R tools and AI-enabled applications across clinical development, analysis, and regulatory submissions.

Objective benchmarking and evaluation of these tools is currently constrained by the lack of high-quality, publicly available clinical trial datasets.


Existing public datasets (e.g., CDISC Pilot 1) are:
- Outdated and not aligned with current CDISC standards or industry practices
- Limited in scale and complexity
- Insufficient for evaluating modern workflows, including AI-assisted analysis, automation, and end-to-end submissions


There is a clear need for modern, realistic, and reusable synthetic clinical trial data that can support:
- Tool demonstration
- Method evaluation
- Community development and education

# Development phase 1
Use CDISC Pilot 1 data as reference
